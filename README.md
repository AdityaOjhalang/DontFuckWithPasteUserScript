# Enhanced Don't Fuck With Paste

## Description
The **Enhanced Don't Fuck With Paste** userscript allows you to paste in any input field, bypassing web design restrictions that prevent this functionality. This script is inspired by the "Don't Fuck With Paste" web extension by Aaron Raimist and has been enhanced with additional features.

## Features
- Allows copy, paste, cut, and dragstart events in input fields.
- Excludes specific domains to prevent potential issues with certain websites.
- Simple and effective solution to bypass annoying web restrictions on copy-pasting.

## Installation
1. Install a userscript manager extension for your browser:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

## Usage
Once installed, the script will automatically run on all web pages except those explicitly excluded. It will enable copy, paste, cut, and dragstart functionalities on input fields where they are typically restricted.

## Excluded Domains
The script will not run on the following domains to prevent potential conflicts:
- facebook.com
- messenger.com
- google.com
- github.com
- imgur.com
